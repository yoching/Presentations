# Agenda

1. Coordinator Pattern
1. Inspirations
1. Architecture
1. How it changed the development flow?

---
# Sample Code

- yoching/iOSAppArchitectureSample [^1]

# Coordinator Pattern [^2] [^3]

- Basic idea: extract transition logics from VC
  (do not write `present(UIViewController)`, `pushViewController` **inside** UIViewController)
- Objects to handle transition = Coordinator
- View Controllers can be isolated each other -> DI friendly
- Other names: Router (in VIPER), Wireframe, Navigation, ...


<!-- - With this pattern, View Controllers can be isolated each other -> Dependency Injection -->

# Problems of this pattern

- 2 tasks in Coordinator
 - View Transition
 - Dependency Injection

- hard to test
- cannot replace with stub objects

---
# Inspirations

- Minimizing Decision Fatigue to Improve Team Productivity @ try! swift 2017 [^4]
  - **Application / UI / Components** (Project Organization)
- Dependency Injection  @ wikipedia [^5]
  - Manual DI / Automatic DI (DI container)
- Deep Linking at Kickstarter @ SwiftTalk [^6]
  - *Routing* logics

# Architecture

![inline fill](./images/Architecture.png)

---
# 2 Types of Objects

- Runtime Objects
  - several objects for app runtime
  - testable (all dependencies are injected)
- Dependency Management
  - doing Dependency Injection
  - no need to test (like setting file)

---
# Sample Projects

- yoching/iOSAppArchitectureSample [^1]

- yoching/JSONPlaceholderViewer [^7] more practical sample using ReactiveSwift

# Development Workflow

| situation | workflow |
| --- | --- |
| make service | make service<br>-> update `components` |
| make view | make VC & VM <br>-> make function at `ViewFactory` |
| make transition | update `coordinator` |

---
# Result

- Coordinator: only view transition
- Factory & Components: Dependency Injection
- No SingletonðŸ˜„
- *App / Components / UI* is good for object organizing (not only folder structures)
